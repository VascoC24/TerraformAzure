    cd Terraform-Azure
    ```

2. **Configure Azure credentials:**

    Make sure you're logged in to Azure via CLI:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

3. **Initialize Terraform:**

    The following command will download the necessary providers and set up the Terraform state:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4. **Check the execution plan:**
